# Spray Madness
Spray whatever, wherever you want with Spray Madness! This mod allows you to import custom images as graffiti and allows you to spray all surfaces in the game with them! Mark important locations, annotate Redstone contraptions, or decorate your base with fancy art! The best part? Everything is saved client-side, meaning if you spray something on a server or on a Realm, it will be saved!

## Key Features
- Ability to load custom images as graffiti and spray them in singleplayer worlds, servers and Realms
- Spray Wheel that can hold 8 sprays at once for quick access in-game
- Emissive sprays that glow in the dark!
- Spray Gallery to manage all your sprays, accessible from the main menu and while playing!
- Everything you spray will be saved locally
- Custom sprays can also be loaded through resource packs, allowing you to create spray packs!

## Planned Features 
- Ability to define sprays on a server and restrict clients only to those sprays, to let players see each other's sprays
- Animated sprays
- Custom shaders for sprays
